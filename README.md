### Bugs

### Validator Testing

<li>HTML</li>

Upon validation using [W3C HTML Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input), a warning advised that the hero-image was missing a header. This was resolved by adding a header and setting the CSS to display:none. Repeating the validation then confirmed there were no errors.

![W3C HTML Validation results](assets/images/htmlvalidator.jpg)

<li>CSS</li>

No errors were found when passing through the [Jigsaw CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input).

![Jigsaw CSS Validation results](assets/images/cssvalidator.jpg)

<li>Accessibility</li>

The colour scheme chosen was passed through the [Color Tool](https://m2.material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=1&view.right=0&primary.color=E65100&secondary.color=FFEB3B) website to check the color palette against accessibility.
I confirmed that color and fonts are accessible and easy to read by running the wesbsite through Lighthouse in devtools.
